This project will explore new design concepts for a miniaturized spectrometer that can detect smaller concentrations of greenhouse gases while collecting high-resolution images that make the system less vulnerable to alignment issues or camera flaws. The miniature platform will be designed to meet the size, weight, and power requirements for commercial use on micro- and nanosatellites. The system will be evaluated to identify performance improvements like better communication with other systems, lower production costs, and streamlined product designs that will have no moving parts. This project will give Canadian industry a competitive edge in the $2 billion greenhouse gas measurement market and provide better alternatives to meet customer needs.

However, current rover technology is expensive and requires continuous management by operators back on Earth. Using rovers will be more cost-effective if they are able to perform more tasks on their own with more flexible options for the operators that manage them. 

This project will develop easy-to-use mission control software to support ongoing, low-cost rover operations and allow rovers to navigate and carry out tasks more independently. The software will be cloud-based to allow commercial space companies, mission operators, and researchers operate frequent, short-duration lunar missions from anywhere on Earth. This project will help to lower the cost of lunar rover missions, making space exploration more accessible a to wider range of Canadian companies.

Visual impairment as a consequence of long-duration space travel is a serious challenge to human exploration.

These changes yield ocular structural and functional alterations in a significant fraction of astronauts, not always resolved after Earth landing.
We surmise that ocular rigidity, determined by the shape and elasticity of the outer layers of the eye, plays a major role in the development of the disease, and is a risk factor that can be screened in a non-invasive fashion.""
