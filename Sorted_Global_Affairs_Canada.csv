The project builds on a 4-year pilot project implemented by War Child Canada that used interactive radio instruction (IRI) to reach learners unable to participate in the formal school system. In conflict-affected areas, schools are often damaged or used as militia bases, and fear of abduction by armed groups as well as extensive population displacement has led many children to miss out on education or experience disruption in their studies. It is estimated that 7.3 million school-aged children (5-17 years old), including 3.9 million girls, are out of school.

Project activities include: (1) expanding the curriculum for IRI to include the full cycle of primary school grades; (2) building the capacity of officials from the ministries of Education and Social Affairs, as well as teachers and education assistants, to provide alternative learning services to out-of-school children that are gender-responsive, inclusive, and adapted to crisis and conflict-affected contexts; (3) establishing 10 IRI learning centres in three provinces (South Kivu, Kinshasa and a third province to be determined); (4) studying IRI as a means of delivering gender-responsive alternative education to out-of-school children and children with disabilities, including girls; (5) conducting engagement activities led by community members targeting mothers, fathers, youth and key community figures, aim to promote behavioural change and to help redefine social norms around gender, the status of girls, and the importance of girls‚Äô education.

Through the project, it is expected that approximately 1,250 girls and 1,250 boys aged 9-16 complete a full year of education delivered in the IRI centres, with the eventual full broadcast of the IRI program potentially reaching over 700,000 children in three target provinces. It is also expected that approximately 6,600 (minimum 50% women) community members participate in community engagement sessions, and 80 stakeholder groups be engaged in consultations on the national IRI curriculum and planning for sustainability of the IRI approach.","The expected outcomes for this project include: (1) improved provision of innovative, gender-responsive and alternative education services in conflict-affected and marginalized communities; and (2) reduced barriers to education and learning (both formal and non-formal) for children and children with disabilities, including girls, in conflict-affected and marginalized communities.",This transaction was not previously disclosed. ,Global Affairs Canada | Affaires mondiales Canada

The existing fragile legal framework in Mozambique fails to ensure adequate and suitable protection of children and girls, particularly against early marriages. The Committee on Social Affairs, Gender, Technologies and Social Media (the Committee) of the Assembly of the Republic (AR) is working in partnership with the Coalition for the Elimination of Early Marriage (CECAP) to address the recommendation to establish a minimum age of marriage at 18 years of age and explicitly prohibiting marriage before 18 years of age, as well as harmonizing laws and reviewing customary practises to avoid early marriage. In December 2017, a ""Preliminary Draft Law for Preventing and Combating Early Engagement, Marriage and Unions"" was elaborated and it expected to submit the draft law by December 2018.
